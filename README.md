# Jokes from Reddit

This is my first project ever working with javascript.

It is really simple, it gets the r/jokes/new or
r/jokes/hot page in JSON, then displays it an a (in my opinion)
easier to read format.I have also made some options with some functions
and global variables.

I have tried to keep the design as minimalistic and as "barebones" as possible.


My only further plan with this is to make a version with pictures, which will be easy to do with a few modifications.
